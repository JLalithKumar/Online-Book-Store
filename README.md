# 📚 Online Book Store

A simple **Command-Line Interface (CLI)** based system to manage books and users efficiently.

## 🎯 Objective
To create a Java program that allows users to **view, search, and buy books**, while maintaining **user-specific purchase history**, and also provides admin functionality for managing the book inventory.

## ✨ Features
- 👤 **User Login** – Enter a username to start managing purchases.  
- 📖 **View Books** – Display all available books in the store.  
- 🔍 **Search Book** – Search books by title or author.  
- 🛒 **Buy Book** – Purchase a book if it is in stock; adds to user’s purchase history.  
- 📋 **View My Purchases** – Display all books purchased by the current user.  
- ➕ **Admin - Add Book** – Add a new book with title, author, price, and stock.  
- ❌ **Admin - Remove Book** – Remove a book from the store by ID.

## 🛠️ Implementation Details
- 📚 **Book Class** – Encapsulates book data (ID, title, author, price, stock).  
- 👤 **User Class** – Stores username and purchased books for each user.  
- 🏪 **BookStore Class** – Handles book management and purchase logic.  
- 📂 **ArrayList** – Dynamically stores books and users.  
- 🖥️ **Menu-Driven Interface** – Provides intuitive CLI options for interacting with the store.

## ✅ Conclusion
This project demonstrates **object-oriented programming** concepts in Java. It provides a practical example of designing a structured CLI program for a user-interactive online book store with user-specific purchase tracking and admin management.
